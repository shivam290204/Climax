# Delhi-NCR Pollution Intelligence Platform

An AI-powered platform for real-time pollution source identification, 72-hour AQI forecasting, citizen health alerts, and evidence-based policy recommendations for Delhi-NCR region.

## üöÄ Mission
Transform pollution monitoring from reactive reporting to proactive intelligence that empowers citizens and optimizes government interventions.

## üîß Core Innovations

### 1. Real-Time Source Attribution Engine
- Instant identification of pollution sources (stubble burning, traffic, industry) using AI
- ML models trained on chemical fingerprinting data from CPCB stations
- Replace 2-4 week lab analysis with instant AI identification

### 2. Hyperlocal Forecasting Grid
- Predict AQI at 1km x 1km resolution across Delhi-NCR
- 72-hour predictions with confidence intervals
- Street-level predictions vs city-wide averages

### 3. Predictive Policy Impact Simulator
- Forecast effectiveness of pollution control measures before implementation
- Evidence-based policy decisions with quantified outcomes
- Cost-benefit optimization algorithms

### 4. Personalized Health Intelligence System
- AI-powered individual health recommendations
- Adaptive recommendation engine that learns from user feedback
- Integration with health wearables for exposure correlation

### 5. Multi-Modal Data Fusion Platform
- Combine 5+ different data sources for comprehensive intelligence
- Real-time APIs: CPCB, NASA MODIS, IMD weather, traffic density
- Most comprehensive pollution monitoring system in India
